# Laboratory Exercises for Week 9: Introduction to Functions Procedures
- in compliance to AMA OEd's ITE7101 course requirement

Task to be implemented on this repository:

1.	Write a program that can divide six non-zero integers (two integers per division) from the user and display the result to the user. Create a function that will perform the division operation. Display only the non-decimal part of the quotient.
2.	Write a program that will accept a short value from 10 to 99 and display them per digit (separated by a space).
3.	Write a program that will display the nth Fibonacci number. Create a function that will generate the nth Fibonacci number. Fibonacci numbers are numbers from the Fibonacci sequence which follows the pattern of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 33, 54â€¦

Each task will be implemented on separate brances.
